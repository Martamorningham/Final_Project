it's just an idea...

 ## Topic: Predicting stock prices based on historical data, and whether certain disasters have an impact on those trends.

 - Historically speaking stocks are influenced by supply and demand. Given their recent trends, we aim to figure out whether those stock prices are going to rise or  fall based on certain disasters. As a base, we are going to compare historical stock data of three major eCommerce stores. Amazon, Target, and Walmart, and perform predictive analysis to determine where their stocks might be in the near future.
