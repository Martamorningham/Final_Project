# Final_Project

## Ideas

Creating a project based on amazon stocks database API to predict future stocks with a machine learning model.

We want to use a Long Short-term Memory LSTM model  to create the stock prediction for Amazon stock prices

A logistic regression model analyzes the available data, and when presented with a new sample, mathematically determines its probability
A dataset is split into training and testing sets in supervised learning. The model uses the training dataset to learn from it. It then uses the testing dataset to assess its performance.

this LTSM model will help graph new data based on the trends of old data.

Would it be interesting if we could have an inoput button so that we can input different tickers and have the mnodel assess them real time

The first line of code uses the predict() method to create predictions based on X_test.
The second line creates a DataFrame of predicted values and actual values.
