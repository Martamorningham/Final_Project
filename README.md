#  The problem: 
Should I invest in Amazon (or other stocks)
stock analysis of Amazon utilizing LTSM (Long Short-Term Memory)
We wanted to work with a model that would allow us to make future predictions in the stock market, specifically for Amazon (Ticker: AMZN)
Data Gathered
Using Yahoo Finance's API we are able to pull historical data, and make calls to keep the data up to date on a regular basis.
Data Stored
We are storing this Data in our SQL database
LTSM Module
Training our Nueral Network to predict future stock price based on the past performance seen in our historical data. Utilizing our own SQL database, fed with information from the Yahoo Finanance API, we will train our LTSM module to predict and visualize the future price flucations of Amazon (or other stocks), to help make more informed market decisions going forward.
